# Convert-Kilometers-to-Meters

write a Python program to convert kilometers to meters step by step.

Input: 1.2

Output: 1200

Step 1: Understand the problem
We need to write a program that takes the number of kilometers as input and converts it into meters. The conversion formula is:

1 kilometer = 1000 meters

We'll get the number of kilometers from the user as input and then convert it into meters.

Step 2: Get the kilometers from the user
First, let's ask the user to enter the number of kilometers. We'll use the input() function to get the value.
Now we have the number of kilometers as a string. But we need it as a number to do calculations. Let's convert it to a float.

Step 3: Convert kilometers to meters
Now that we have the number of kilometers as a float, we can convert it into meters. We'll multiply it by 1000, which is the conversion factor.

Step 4: Round the result to an integer
The output should be an integer. So, we need to round the result of our calculation to an integer.

Step 5: Print the result
Finally, we'll print the number of meters using the print() function.
